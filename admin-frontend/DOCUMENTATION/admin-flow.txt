UX & Interaction notes (important)
    •	Always ask confirmation for destructive actions and show consequences (refunds, notification to user).
    •	Show clear success/failure messages with next steps.
    •	Provide context-sensitive help (tooltip) for every complex field (e.g., commission rate).
    •	Provide previews for email / SMS templates and coupon banners.
    •	Use soft validations (warnings) for risky operations (e.g., mass delete, resend webhook, issue refund).
    •	Use optimistic updates where safe but verify server result for critical operations (refunds, payouts).
    •	For bulk operations, provide progress indicator and an undo window where possible.
    •	Every page should have export option where data is tabular.
    •	Provide role-based visibility in UI — e.g., Finance role sees Payments but not KYC approvals.
________________________________________
Final checks & acceptance criteria (how to know it's complete)
    1.	Every admin page has a clear title, filters, table columns, primary action, and secondary actions.
    2.	All CRUD operations have forms with validations and success / error flows.
    3.	Complex operations (refunds/payouts/assign) use confirm modals and log the action in audit logs.
    4.	All exports (CSV/Excel/PDF) are available from list pages.
    5.	Role-based access enforced: unauthorized UI & APIs return proper 403.
    6.	Media previews and downloads work for photos/audio; retention policy in place.
    7.	Notifications dispatch (test) and show deliverability stats.
    8.	Celery tasks monitorable and retryable.
    9.	Admin users can impersonate customers safely (with audit) for troubleshooting.
    10.	Admin panel is responsive and usable on 1366×768 and mobile for quick checks.
